Everyday we hear a lot of stories of people coming from all kinds of professions on earth to programming, and whenever I tell someone about my background and how I got into this field they raise their eyebrows in surprise.

So my story isn't a different one, except that I've graduated from university with a technical degree that is relatively a highly esteemed one.

<h2>A Short Background</h2>
Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to build stuff. As I grew up I studied hard to get a degree in engineering and after a long journey I’ve been able to graduate as a civil engineer back in 2018. Now I can get a job and start supporting myself and my family, and life will welcome me in her arms, great right? Nope It wasn't great at all.

It was the beginning of another ten months of unemployment, hopelessness, and confusion. Due to the bad economical situation of where I live, there was a huge unemployment rate in the sector, I couldn't find a job even though I've exhausted all my means.

During that time I knew that I couldn't keep living this way, and I was afraid that it would take me forever to land a job. So I've managed to do the impossible for me at that time in that psychological state of being.

<h2>How I Taught Myself To Code</h2>
One time I was passing time on the internet when I stumbled upon an article of someone that was able to land a job at a high-tech company as a self-taught software engineer. That sparked a whole lot of possibilities and doors to explore and go through. That's exactly what I wanted, a career where only your hard work and skills will take you far.

But I had recently graduated, and I can't start all over again in a field that is completely unrelated to what I've been studying the last five years. Even though I decided to give it a go to see if I would enjoy this kind of new thing.

I hopped on the first "How to program a web page" search result, and started following the tutorial, and there it was.. my first "Hello world" page filled with floated images of space cats and randomness that I've added for fun! And I've actually enjoyed it (even though It wasn't an actual program).

After that I decided to take it a little more serious, after researching a bit, I found Github Student pack, in which they offer a lot of freebies for students including a trial boot camp for Front-end development offered by Thinkful. I am no longer a student so I had borrowed my friend’s student email and signed up for the pack (apologies Github, I had to do it)

I began learning in the boot camp, but it wasn't an easy thing to do.

I procrastinated a lot, and it was due to the fact that I didn't know if this thing is even right for me and if it will payoff eventually. Not to mention the feeling of being lost and the tons of information that I had to study. I don't know how I even had the will power, but I managed to battle through all that.

Unfortunately, after 2 months of learning I wasn’t able to finish it, I had to drop off what I learnt due to personal circumstances for another 3 months.

After that period I wanted to resume my learning journey but I found out that I had forgotten everything that I learned. I got disappointed and discouraged, I felt like it was a wasted effort, but I couldn't give up, I'm not done until I'm done!

The trial period of the boot camp has expired and now I was looking for a new way to learn. So I signed up for an initiative called MAC (One Million Arab Coders) in which they offered free coding courses, so I enrolled in the front end development path. I had to relearn everything that I learned before and I was able to do that hardly, and it took me about a month and a half to complete. 

But there was one downside to the whole process of learning, I didn't build a single real life project yet.

I found that the first boot camp that I didn’t complete was much more comprehensive and had a lot of projects to build, so what did I do? I had borrowed my other friend's student email (apologies Github, I had to do it again) and signed up for the boot camp to continue from where I stopped. I’ve been able to build small projects like a Youtube search engine and a static web page, nothing fancy only a demonstration of what I learned.

Still I felt that I’m only scratching the surface. I wanted to bridge the technical knowledge gap that I had in the field.

What was the best way to bridge it? For me it was through working on a real website with real people.

I found an online platform in which they requested a web developer volunteer to work on their website. I doubted myself that I’m not ready yet, but I gave it a shot anyway. So they gave me a couple of tasks to work on and deliver, and was able to do so. I started working on their website and was able to learn a lot of stuff along the way.

After 3 months of working with them, I was still feeling down, because I was not able to make any kind of income out of programming despite of all the efforts made. I needed cash badly so now I had to buckle up, get my act together and start applying for companies.

<h2>How I Landed My Job</h2>
I started emailing companies for open positions. I would write a cover letter telling my story and how serious about what I’m doing, and I would attach a couple of projects that I had worked on. That process continued for about one month and finally I got a reply from a web development company!

They arranged an interview, I went there, got stressed and messed it up! I couldn’t even answer a single question correctly. No wonder I got rejected for the role. But that didn’t disappoint me at all, In fact it encouraged me to keep going. All my worries of rejection because of my background are gone with the fact that I got this interview.

All I had to do now was to learn from the mistakes that I had made.

In September 2018, there was a job fair that many companies from all kinds of fields in the country participated in. My friends decided to go there to apply for engineering jobs (non-IT based) and I went with them to seek if there's any civil engineering jobs.

As I expected, there was not a single civil engineering company in the fair, but there was a lot of IT companies. So I had my plan B covered and ready, I had prepared my Front-end developer CV on a flash drive (It was almost a blank CV), and I went over all the IT booths. I had a chit-chat with the people over there, gave them my CV, and took their business cards. I went home later that day, I emailed all the contacts that I’ve made showing my interest along with a cover letter using the recipe I mentioned earlier.

Soon after I did that, I received an email from one of those companies where they wanted to arrange an interview with me!

This time I am not gonna make the mistakes that I made before, I’ve studied a lot of interview questions and prepared hard for it.

When I began the interview, the HR manager who contacted me said that my story caught his eyes, and the reason why he invited me to the interview was out of curiosity, he wanted to hear my story and the reason why I did that. So I told him my story, and he was impressed by the amount of effort I had put. 

Now the technical interview began. Most of the questions were about JavaScript and jQuery, I managed to answer with confidence. Later on I was told that I’ve been able to answer over 90% of the questions correctly and was the best candidate out of twenty IT fresh grads! -It felt great to be honest-

So after two weeks or so, there it is.. The moment that I’ve been working hard for the past 10 months is finally here..

<b>I got the Job Offer!</b>

<h2>What Next?</h2>
It’s been about 2 years since I joined the company, and I’m still working as a Software engineer specializing in Angular Framework. And even to this day, I still have moments of: “what the heck am I doing here?” and I still doubt myself for being in such a never-imagined-to-be-in domain.

But as the days go on, I’m loving programming more and more with each line of code that I write, and I’m thankful that I was able to make this decision and stick to it to the end and seeing the efforts paying off.
